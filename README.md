# Tenways_Activator
If the OLED display of your Tenways CGO600 Bike is broken, this activator can get it going again

This code was developed for an Arduino Beetle (very small Arduino compatible board, based on Arduino Leonardo).

Normally the OLED display sends a fixed stream of commands (begins with 0x16) or requests for data (begins with 0x11) to the controller.
